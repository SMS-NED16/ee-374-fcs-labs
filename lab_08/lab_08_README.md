# Lab Session 08 - Performance Characteristics of 1st and 2nd Order Systems

In this lab session, MATLAB was used to investigate the step response of first and second order mass-spring systems in terms of their
performance characteristics such as
- rise time
- settling time
- overshoot
- peak time
- steady state error
