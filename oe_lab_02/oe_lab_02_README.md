# Open Ended Lab 02 - PID Controllers

An open-ended lab investigation focusing on the use of *P*otential-*I*ntegral-*D*ifferential controllers for tuning the response of a 
mass-spring feedback system. Deliverables are
- To investigate the process of tuning a simple mass-spring system.
- To qualitatively analyse the effects of P, I, and D controllers on a system's response.
- To use MATLAB/Simulink to identify the best controller for a given mass-spring system.

Completed with Faiq Siddiqui (EE-16164), Syed Daniyal Ali Shah (EE-16165), Syed Abdul Haseeb Qadri (EE-16194), and Aymen Batool (EE-16084).
