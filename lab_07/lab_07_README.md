# Lab Session 07 - Modelling a DC Motor

In this lab session, a DC motor was modelled using Simulink. Each of the following parameters were varied to investigate their effect on
both the magnitude and speed of the motor's response.
- Armature Resistance
- Armature Inductance
- Back EMF Constant
- Moment of Inertia of the load
- Rotational Friction of the load
