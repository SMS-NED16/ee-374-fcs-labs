# Open Ended Lab 01 - Modelling a Practical Rotational Mechanical System

In this open-ended lab investigation, a simple permanent magnet DC motor was modelled and investigated in MATLAB. 
Specifically, the deliverables of this investigation were
- to demonstrate a theoretical understanding of the working principle of a DC Motor
- to derive transfer functions for the PMDC motor's electrical and mechanical subsystems.
- to integrate these transfer functions into a single electromechanical transfer function.
- to derive the state equations for this transfer function.
- to implement this transfer function in MATLAB
- to investigate the effects of each parameter on the overall response of the PMDC Motor.
