# Lab Session 02 - Mathematical Modelling in MATLAB

This lab session focuses on using MATLAB's `ode45` solver to obtain a numerical solution for a differential equation describing
the behaviour of a simple mass spring system with frictional force. 

`cruise_speed.m` is called by `cruise_speed_test.m` to solve the differential equation, with values of `M`, `B`, and `k`being initialized in the
latter.

The programmes were then used to investigate the effect varying each parameter has on the overall system behaviour in terms of velocity
and displacement.
